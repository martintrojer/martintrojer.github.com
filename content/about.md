I am Martin Trojer, a software contractor based in the UK, specializing in software development using functional programming languages such as Haskell, Purescript, Elm, and Clojure.

On this blog, I cover a range of programming topics that have captured my interest, including technical discussions and reflections on the software industry. I aim to provide code examples and other resources that are publicly accessible, serving as both a reference for the future and a helpful aid for readers.

If you find any of my posts intriguing or if you require assistance with software development, please don't hesitate to reach out. For more information about my professional assignments, please refer to my [LinkedIn profile](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/martintrojer).
