    Let's say you want to define a new unit representing the amount of alcohol in a can of
    (quality) <span data-key="example-4-0" data-step="0.1">3.2</span> beer. Keep in mind
    that <output for="example-4-0" class="normal">3.2</output> beer is measured by
    alcohol/weight, while almost all other liquors (and many beers) are usually measured
    in alcohol/volume. The density ratio between water and alcohol is given by:

    Unit definitions, where they depend on scrubbed values, will also recalculate &mdash;

    Water is thus 1.267 times denser than alcohol.
    <output for="example-4-0" class="normal">3.2</output> beer (measured by weight) is
    thus actually <output for="example-3">4</output> percent alcohol as measured by
    volume. Now let's set that variable in terms of a beer's density of alcohol per volume
    so we can compare:

    How many cases in a keg? (A keg is a normal-sized keg, what those in the beer industry
    would call a "half barrel," or <code>1/2 :beerbarrel</code> in Frinj notation. I don't
    think they sell full barrels. I've never seen one. It would weigh 258 pounds. A "pony

  <p>
    This makes the ship <output for="example-13">280</output> times denser than water.
    This is <output for="example-14">280</output> times denser than iron and
    <output for="example-15">12</output> times denser than any known element! As the ship
    is actually more a thin disc than a sphere, it would actually be even denser. Since it
    contains lots of empty space, parts of it would have to be much, much denser.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the object is this dense and has such a large mass, what is its surface gravity?
    Surface gravity is given by G mass / radius<sup>2</sup>, where G is the gravitational
    constant (which Frinj knows about):
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    <code id="example-16">
      (-> (fj_ (fj :G <output for="example-13-1">0.25</output> :moonmass)

  <p>
    The surface gravity of the spaceship is thus at least
    <output for="example-16">2</output> times earth's gravity &mdash; and that's on the
    rim where gravity is weakest. It would actually be much higher since it's much, much
    flatter than a sphere. I hope you're not the alien that has to go outside and paint
    it.

    I've seen lots of figures about how much heat the human body produces. You can easily
    calculate the upper limit based on how much food you eat a day. Say, you eat
    <span data-key="example-26-0" data-step="50">2,000</span> Calories a day (again, food
    Calories with a capital "C" are equal to 1,000 calories with a little "c").

    So, your average power and/or heat output is slightly less than a 100-watt bulb.
    (Note that your heat is radiated over a much larger area so the temperature is much
    lower.) Many days I could be replaced entirely with a 100-watt bulb and have no
    discernible effect on the universe.

  <p>
    Superman is always rescuing school buses that are falling off of cliffs, flying to the
    moon, lifting cars over his head, and generally showing off. So why does he still
    allow so many accidents to happen? Shouldn't he be able to rescue everybody who has a
    Volkswagen parked on their chest? While searching for answers, I found out three
    interesting things about Superman:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>He's 6 feet 3 inches tall.</li>
    <li>He weighs 225 pounds.</li>
    <li>He gets his strength from being charged up with solar energy.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This is enough information to find some answers. Frinj has units
    called <code>:sunpower</code> (the total power radiated by the sun) and
    <code>:sundist</code> (the distance between the earth and the sun). Thus, we can find
    the sun's power that strikes an area at the distance of the earth (knowing the surface
    area of a sphere is 4 pi radius<sup>2</sup>):

    This is about <output for="example-29">1,372</output> watts per square meter. Superman
    is a pretty big guy &mdash; let's say the surface area he can present to the sun is
    <span data-key="example-31-0">12</span> square feet. (This is probably a bit high
    &mdash; it makes him an average of <output for="example-30">23</output> inches wide
    over his entire height.) This allows Superman to charge up at a power of:
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>
    Superman thus charges up at the rate of <output for="example-32">1,530</output>
    joules/sec or <output for="example-32" class="normal">1,530</output> watts. At this
    rate, how long does he have to charge up before he can lift a
    <span data-key="example-33-0">2</span> ton truck over his head? (Knowing energy =
    mass * height * gravity)

  <p>
    So, charging up for <output for="example-33">25</output> seconds allows him to save
    one dumb kid who is acting as a speed bump. So his power is huge but not infinite. He
    couldn't sustain a higher rate (unless he showed off less by lifting the car only a
    foot or two). Lifting a truck every 30 seconds or so isn't bad, though. He could be
    saving a lot more people. So why doesn't he?
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, we've all seen the movie. He's using his super-powers to pick up chicks.
    Literally. Superman decides to take a break from saving lives and takes Lois Lane up
    in the sky for a joyride. So how long does he have to charge up with solar energy to
    fly himself and Lois Lane (let's say she weighs

    <span data-key="example-34-1" data-step="1000">15,000</span> feet?

    So, Superman has to charge up with solar energy for an hour to cart Lois up there.
    With the same energy, he could have saved <output for="example-35">193</output>
    trapped kids. Keep in mind that Lois could do her part, too. If she left her purse
    behind or didn't weigh as much, he'd have more energy left over to save people. If she
    would manage to shed just two pounds of cargo weight, Superman would have enough
    energy to save another kid's life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sure, he's a great guy, and, sure, he's the Defender of Truth, Justice, and the
    American Way, but can't he find a better use for his super-powers than schlepping some
    shiksa into the stratosphere? Shovel my walk, he could, in 3 seconds &mdash; and me

    17,000 years is still a huge underestimate; I don't know how much of your energy
    actually goes into fart production. Oh well. To continue the calculations, let's guess
    your butthole has a diameter of 1 inch (no, you go measure it). Let's also guess that

    What do you think are the most flammable gases in a fart? Most people think it's
    methane, but I found some medical studies that disprove this. Most people hardly have
    any methane in their intestines. For example, one study stated that only 4 out of 11
    people had any detectable methane in their intestines! So what's the rest of the gas?
  </p>

  <table summary="Gases present in human intestines by volume">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Gas</th><th>Percent by volume</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Nitrogen</td><td>64%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Carbon Dioxide</td><td>14%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Hydrogen</td><td>19%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Methane</td><td>3.2%</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Oxygen</td><td>0.7%</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    These studies also note that the average person has 100 milliliters of gas is present
    in their intestinal tract at any given time. The average person expels 400-2,000 ml of
    gas daily (and I'm not talking about through the mouth and nose).
  </p>

  <p>
    Okay, that's almost enough information to figure out available fart energy. Now all we
    need to know is the energy of combustion of the flammable gases. Of the above, only
    hydrogen and methane are readily combustible. Looking up their energies of combustion:
  </p>

  <table summary="Combustion energy of gases in human intestine">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Gas</th><th>Energy of combustion in kJ/mol</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Hydrogen (H2)</td><td>295.8</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Methan (CH4)</td><td>890.8</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    Okay, that's plenty enough information to find out how much energy is released in a
    day of farting! Say you're on the farty end of the scale, and you produce
    <span data-key="example-41-0" data-step="100">2,000</span> ml of gas each day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the energies above are given in kJ/mol, but we have volumes in milliliters.
    As you may have learned in chemistry class, a mole of any gas at standard temperature
    and pressure takes up the same volume. Frinj knows this as <code>:molarvolume</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The total energy in the hydrogen (keeping in mind that hydrogen makes up 19% of the
    <output for="example-41-0">2,000</output> ml volume) is given by:
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    <code id="example-41" data-next="example-42" class="unit">
      (add-unit! :h2energy (fj <output for="example-41-0">2000</output> :ml :per :molarvolume 19 :percent 285.8 :kJ :per :mol))
    </code>
    <code id="example-42" data-next="example-45" class="hidden">
      (-> (fj :h2energy :to :joules) str)
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    The combustible hydrogen thus produces <output for="example-42">4,845</output> joules
    (per day). Now, for the methane, which makes a smaller percentage, but releases more
    energy per mole:
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    <code id="example-43" data-next="example-44" class="unit">
      (add-unit! :methaneenergy (fj <output for="example-41-0">2000</output> :ml :per :molarvolume 3.2 :percent 890.8 :kJ :per :mol))

    <code id="example-44" data-next="example-45" class="hidden">
      (-> (fj :methaneenergy :to :joules) str)
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    The energy in the combustible methane is thus <output for="example-44">2,544</output>
    joules (per day), about half the energy produced from the hydrogen. Thus, the grand
    total of energy produced by combustible farts by a farty person in a day, in food
    Calories (with a capital C, remember &mdash; these are what a physicist would call a
    kilocalorie) is:

    So you want to build an ark, do you? And not an Ark of the Covenant, but the boat.
    How bad was that flood?
  </p>

  <p>
    The bible is also quite precise in its measurement of the flood. Genesis 7:19-20
    states that "And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
    mountains, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did
    the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered."
  </p>

  <p>
    Okay, so the highest mountains of the earth were covered, plus an extra
    <span data-key="example-53-0">15</span> cubits (approx
    <output for="example-54">27</output> feet) for good measure. The current measurements
    for highest mountain is Mt. Everest at 29,030.8 feet (according to the highly dubious
    and utterly non-trustable 2002 Guinness Book of World Records.) I know that Everest is
    growing slowly, (best estimates are 2.4 inches/year) so we'll discount for that.

    About <output for="example-55">28,257</output> feet of water. This was deposited over

    About <output for="example-56">29</output> feet/hour. A good rain around here is about
    an inch an hour.  The very rainiest places on earth like Cherrapunji get about this
    much rain in a year.  (I'm campaigning Colorado farmers to sin a bit more...)

  <p>
    Everyone knows Einstein's E=mc<sup>2</sup> equation, but to apply it is often very
    difficult because the units come out so strange. Let's see, I have mass in pounds, and
    the speed of light is 186,282 miles/second... ummm... what does that come out to? In
    Frinj the calculation becomes transparently simple.

    If you took the matter in a teaspoon of water, and converted that to energy, how many gallons
    of gasoline would that equal?

    Unbelievable. The energy in a teaspoon of water, if we could extract it, is equal to
    burning more than 3 million gallons of gasoline.
