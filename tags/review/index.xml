      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;floatright&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://martintrojer.github.io/assets/images/cookbook/cover.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Clojure Cookbook is part of the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly cookbook series. I&amp;rsquo;d describe this format as a &amp;lsquo;curated wiki in print&amp;rsquo;. The wiki analogy is especially true for this volume since its contents were contributed by some 60 different developers. It&amp;rsquo;s packed with small, bite-sized recipes for solving common problems in Clojure. This is useful for developers across the entire spectrum from beginner to expert.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The content is organized into 11 chapters, each containing a number of recipes. The chapter layout is clear and serves its purpose when looking for content. The book covers a lot of ground, from working with primitives and basic data structures to dealing with databases, writing web apps, and running Hadoop jobs. Each recipe comes with code and/or REPL examples, so it&amp;rsquo;s very easy and enlightening to &amp;lsquo;play along&amp;rsquo;. In contrast to other books with code snippets, the authors have made all recipes self-contained (no other projects/files need to be created and run for the examples to work), which makes it very easy to dive in at any point in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
