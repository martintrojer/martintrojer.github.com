      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a big / legacy C++ app, then you&amp;rsquo;re undoubtedly covered by Greenspun&amp;rsquo;s tenth rule. Let&amp;rsquo;s also say that your home-grown, buggy and slow DSL / scripting language has been pushed to the limit and can not be tweaked any further. What do you do, how can you replace it?&#xA;As you might expect, this is quite a common problem, and embedding scripting languages into a big C/C++ monolith is popular.</description>

      <description>Edit: This post recently re-surfaced on hacker news and caused a bit of a stir, mainly because of a slightly sensational/misleading title (was &amp;ldquo;Why is Clojure so slow?&amp;rdquo;). I wrote this before Rich Hickey&amp;rsquo;s Clojure/Conj 2011 keynote was published, in which he talks about most of my concerns (and outlines possible solutions).&#xA;Clojure is great in many ways, but one thing it can&amp;rsquo;t be accused of is being particularly fast. What I mean by fast here is the speed in which Clojure programs execute.</description>
