      <title>Working with core.async: Blocking calls</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t do anything even remotely blocking inside go-blocks. This is because all the core.async go blocks share a single thread pool, with a very limited number of threads (go blocks are supposed to be CPU bound). So if you have hundreds / thousands of go blocks running conurrently just having a few (a handful really) block &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; go blocks will stop! For a more in-depth explanation see &lt;a href=&#34;https://martintrojer.github.io/post/2013-07-07-coreasync-and-blocking-io/&#34;&gt;this previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One particularly annoying difference between the core.async and &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; is that you can&amp;rsquo;t wrap function calls with the &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; macro. This is due to implementation details of core.async, which can only see the body &amp;lsquo;inside&amp;rsquo; the macro and not the functions it may call. This is obviously not a problem if the called function doesn&amp;rsquo;t interact with any channels, but if it does when you might be in trouble. I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on this subject in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://martintrojer.github.io/post/2013-07-17-non-tailrecursive-functions-in-coreasync/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Working with core.async: Exceptions in go blocks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dealing with exceptions in go blocks/threads is different from normal clojure core. This gotcha is very common when moving your code into core.async go blocks &amp;ndash; all your exceptions are gone! Since the body of a go block is run on a thread pool, it&amp;rsquo;s not much we can do with an exception, thus core.async will just eat them and close the channel. That&amp;rsquo;s what happened in the second snippet &lt;a href=&#34;https://martintrojer.github.io/post/2014-03-09-working-with-coreasync-chaining-go-blocks/&#34;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; result is because the channel we read from is closed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using various Go examples / tutorials to take a deeper look into core.async. The CSP pattern is a very interesting and powerful, it&amp;rsquo;s good move for Clojure to &amp;ldquo;throw in&amp;rdquo; with Go and push this style of programming.&#xA;core.sync works at s-expression level, where some other JVM solutions (Kilim, Pulsar) do the same on byte code level. The main benefit of doing these transforms on s-expression level is that they are applicable to ClojureScript, where CSP can be a very neat way out of callback hell.</description>

      <title>core.async and Blocking IO</title>

      <description>Some time ago I wrote about Asynchronous workflows in Clojure. With the recent release and excitement of core.async, I though it a good time to revisit that post.&#xA;While there are already some good example and comparison-with-go posts out there, I&amp;rsquo;d like to focus on an area often misunderstood, namely async frameworks and blocking APIs (most commonly blocking IO). It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the implications of blocking IO and it&amp;rsquo;s effects on &amp;lsquo;async code&amp;rsquo;, in this case core.</description>
