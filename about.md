My name is Martin Trojer and I'm a software contractor based in the UK. I am currently focusing on software development in functional programming languages (mainly [Clojure](http://clojure.org) and [F#](http://fsharp.org/)). I have a keen interest in new programming languages and frameworks.

In this blog I write about various topics related to programming that have caught my attention, both technical and musings about the software industry. I try to make code examples and other resources publicly available, both for future reference and to assist readers.

Feel free to get in touch if you're interested in any of my posts or if you are looking for assistance with software development. See my [linked in profile](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/martintrojer) for more details about my professional assignments.
