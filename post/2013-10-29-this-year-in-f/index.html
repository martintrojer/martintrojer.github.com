				<p>For the third year running, here&rsquo;s my annual (and extremely subjective) review of the state of the F# language, its community and other loosely connected things. How would I sum up the noises coming from F# the last year? Pretty darn awesome. A lot of what&rsquo;s been happening was on my wish-list outlined in <a href="https://martintrojer.github.io/post/2012-10-24-the-future-of-net-lies-in-mono-the-future-of-f-lies-in-monodevelop/">last year&rsquo;s post</a>. What are the highlights?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F# foundation</a>. This is a fantastic move in the right direction, and as the <a href="http://fsharp.org/foundation.html">mission statement</a> hints at, all about making F# a viable technology no matter what Microsoft does next. If you haven&rsquo;t looked at the site yet please do, it&rsquo;s an impressive collection of docs (like getting started guides), real world testimonials and more.</p>
<p>One thing I want to point out is the <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/">F# organization on github</a>. This is already an impressive collection of projects, and most importantly it hosts the open source edition of the F# compiler and core libraries. This is a nice improvement over the once-every-3-year code drop approach that F# have adopted so far. I&rsquo;m still waiting for the official announcement that this github repo is now the official (and only) version of F#, something tells me it&rsquo;s just around the corner.</p>
<p>The next huge thing is meteoric rise of <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, the custodians of the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono project</a> &ndash; which I predicted is the future of .NET (and thus F#). Xamarin focuses on tooling and libraries for mobile devices, and their success it&rsquo;s a very good thing for Mono in general. I would personally like to see a bit more focus on Mono for server / back-end usage but I understand Xamarin have to go where the money is. My small F# toys are constantly getting faster with Mono, but they are still a factor 2-4 off the Windows benchmark. I do think Mono will eventually catch up, and more importantly I think it&rsquo;s going to take the lead on ARM platforms &ndash; which is going to be important for servers in the future. <a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/statuses/382307711213260801">ARMv8 is the dogs b**s.</a></p>
<p>Mr de Icaza seems to warming to F#, and recently spoke at a F# event at a <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/keynote-4066">skillsmatter event in New York</a>. Xamarin is also hiring people with F# background, this is a slam dunk for F# is you ask me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loved meeting the F# lovers and trainees at <a href="https://twitter.com/skillsmatter">@skillsmatter</a> training in NYC. See you online peeps! &ndash; Miguel de Icaza (<a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/statuses/380835425176539136">@migueldeicaza</a>) September 19, 2013</p>

<p>The shift in focus to open source (and in effect Mono) is perhaps best expressed in Don Syme&rsquo;s <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/keynote-4011">F# in the Open Source World talk</a>. I&rsquo;ve attended this talk in March this year, and I really enjoyed it. If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, please do &ndash; it&rsquo;s awesome. And yes, there is a live demo of F# in Emacs with &lsquo;intellisense&rsquo; / auto-complete.</p>
<p>Talking about open source, <a href="http://www.nuget.org/">Nuget</a> continues to grow in strength. It&rsquo;s still orders of magnitude off maven central / sontatype but there certainly is some very good stuff available. Which is interesting indeed for a Microsoft community, where open source software has always been frowned upon. It&rsquo;s really good news for F#, since C# interrop is excellent. One cool project I want to pick out is <a href="http://funscript.info/">Funscript</a>, a really clever F# quotation to JavaScript compiler. <a href="http://zbray.com/">Zach</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/">Tomas</a> are doing a great good job here, you should check out the demos.</p>
<p>The introduction of Type Providers in F# 3 has spurred a lot of excitement. This <a href="http://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/f-type-providers-news-from-the-battlefields/">list of available providers</a> are impressive and growing. They really are a nice bridge to the convenience of a dynamically typed languages from the comforts of your Hindley-Milner type system.</p>
<p>So what about good old Microsoft? Well, any comments on the Windows8-SurfaceRT-Ballmer-XBONE-Nokia-Elop-year-of-fail is kind of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqmj-9XlDzY">redundant at this stage</a>. Windows (and .NET) continues to be strong in the client space. I witnessed this firsthand many times this year, big companies use Linux / JVM / Oracle for back-end stuff and Windows for clients. If a thick client is needed then you go XAML, if not, you let the Java guys do a web UI. F# would do very well in the server space, but for that to really take off it needs a rock-solid runtime for Linux. Mono is the key to get F# back on the <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">tech radar</a>.</p>
<p>So Xamarin is making C# / .NET work really well in the mobile space, and then there is <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and <a href="http://monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>. It&rsquo;s good news all round for client software and .NET. F# have an important role to play here, and some bloggers/communities has caught on to the gaming trend, like <a href="http://7sharpnine.com/">Dave</a>, <a href="http://neildanson.wordpress.com/">Neil</a> and the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/london-gamecraft">London Gramecraft</a>. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see where this goes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close off with my old reminder to all F#-ers out there; Microsoft is a fickle mistress, who will randomly drop a technology on a whim. This year F# has taken many important steps to break free from Microsoft and take control of its own fate. This work must continue.</p>
